            <h2>Caspar (2023-now)</h2>
            <p>Caspar is Bingo's son and therefore feels like a grand kid to us👶. 
                He is smart and (just a little bit) cheeky😏 
                (click on 'Read More' below for his page if curious😜). 
                We are very proud to share that like his father🐕‍🦺, he has been 
                selected as a breeding dog for Vision Australia🏅. 
                You can find photos of his puppies, 
                our great grand puppies 🥰 in his page.</p>

            <h2>Bingo (2021-2023)</h2>
            <p>Bingo was such a sweet heart and always eager to learn and help. 
                He did so well at the 12 month assessment🏆 that he was selected to be a breeding dog. 
                He had 27 puppies 🐾 before moving to Adelaide to become a guide dog🐕‍🦺
                (Click on 'Read More' below for puppy photos on his page😍!). 
                We miss him a lot but feel blessed that we can care for Caspar, his son❤️!</p>

            <h2>Kanga (2020-2021)</h2>
            <p>Kanga was the sweet boy 💝 who went through all the covid lockdown with us. 
                He loves sitting beside the boys when they play the violin 🎻, 
                sometimes even singing along 🎶. 
                What amazes us is how he has different "songs" for different occasions -  
                sometimes we truly feel he's trying to speak human language 🤓.</p>

            <h2>Micky (2019-2020)</h2>
            <p>Micky was the very first guide dog puppy we fostered 🥰. 
                He was super playful yet so gentle and calm in the library 📚, 
                so much so that we thought he should be a librarian 🤓 - 
                well, except for his not-so-quiet snoring from time to time 🤪! 
                The kids called him our "snoozing librarian" 💤.</p>

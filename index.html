            <h2>Caspar (2023-now)</h2>
            <p>Caspar is Bingo's son and therefore feels like a grand kid to us👶. 
                He is smart and (just a little bit) cheeky😏 (read his page for details😜). 
                We are very proud to share that like his father🐕‍🦺, he has been 
                selected as a breeding dog for Vision Australia🏅, 
                and we look forward to meeting our great grand puppies🥰.</p>

            <h2>Bingo (2021-2023)</h2>
            <p>Bingo was such a sweet heart and always eager to learn and help. 
                He did so well at the 12 month assessment🏆 that he was selected to be a breeding dog. 
                He had 27 puppies 🐾 before moving to Adelaide to become a guide dog🐕‍🦺. 
                We miss him a lot but feel blessed that we can care for Caspar, his son❤️!</p>

            <p>Kanga was the sweet boy who went through all the covid lockdown with us. 
                He loves sitting beside the boys when they play the violin🎻, 
                sometimes even singing along🎶.</p>

            <p>Micky was the the very first guide dog puppy we fostered🥰. 
                He was super playful yet so gentle and calm too in the library📚, 
                so and so that we thought he should be a librarian🤓.</p>

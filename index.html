            <p>Caspar is Bingo's son and therefore feels like a grand kid to us. He is smart and (just a little bit) cheeky, and loves learning new commands and get lots of cuddles.</p>

            <p>Bingo did so well at the 12 month assessment that he was selected to be a breeding dog. He had 27 puppies in his time with us. And Caspar was one of them!</p>

            <p>Micky was the the very first guide dog puppy we fostered. He was super playful yet so gentle and calm too in the library, so and so that we thought he should be a librarian.</p>

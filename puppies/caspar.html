        <p>Caspar was Bingo's son and therefore our grand kid 👶. He was a bit cheeky 😏, why do I say that?
        Seeing-eye-dog puppies go to the bathroom under a command and got a treat afterwards 🍪.
            To make sure that he got as much treats as possible, he would save up his "business" and 
            do it in small batches 🤣

                    <p>Caspar was very lucky to have spent quite some time with Bingo 
                        both when he was about 9 weeks old
                        then later near his 1st birthday. 🍰 
                        Both times Bingo was having a break from training and
                        was staying at our place. 
                        They played a lot and Bingo was very good with Caspar. 
                        Caspar used his full force when playing tug-of-war with father, 
                        guess that's how dogs show their love 💖

                    <p>When he was small, Caspar was a bit nervous in moving cars 🚗.
                        To help him feel more relaxed, we took him on as many roadtrips
                        as we could, and brought him on various public transportation. 
                        He got used to it and even started to enjoy it! 🦮

                    <p>I couldn't believe I am typing this, but like his father🐕‍🦺, 
                        Casper passed his exam with flying colors🏅 and was selected
                        as a breeding dog for the Seeing-eye-dog program! 
                        We were so proud! 🥳 And so looking forward to meeting
                        our great grand puppies! 🐾🤗

## About Fostering Seeing Eye Dogs
Our journey with the puppies has brought me and my family tremendous joy! I must admit it was always bittersweet when we had to say goodbye to these puppies when they turned 1. But knowing they will play such an important role in another person's life and being loved ‚ù§Ô∏è and relied on as a guide-dog ü¶Æ, we know it is all worthwhile.

## How to Navigate
Each puppy has their own dedicated page where you can follow their journey from when they first arrive to their formal training. Click on a puppy's name to see their full story.
